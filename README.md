# FUT - Fallen's Utility Toolkit

Purpose:
This project is intended to be a lightweight, extensible utility toolkit built with Python's Tkinter GUI library.
Over time the repository will grow to include a collection of small, focused tools (file utilities, text processors, automation helpers, network testers, etc.) that users can enable or disable from the GUI.

## Running the Application

To start the application, navigate to and run the `main.py` file:

```
python main.py
```

## Adding Buttons

Once the application is running, you can add buttons dynamically. Each button can be associated with a specific action defined in the `button_actions.py` file. 

Feel free to explore and modify the code to add more functionality or customize the actions associated with the buttons!

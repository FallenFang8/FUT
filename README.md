# Tkinter Button App

This project is a simple Tkinter application that allows users to dynamically add buttons with associated actions. It serves as a demonstration of how to create a GUI application using Python's Tkinter library.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, navigate to the `src` directory and run the `main.py` file:

```
python main.py
```
